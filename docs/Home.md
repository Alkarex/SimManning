## Project Description
SimManning is a C#.NET library containing a discrete-event simulation engine dedicated to manning / staffing, especially for domains involving a succession of phases.
An example of basic domain is provided, but the idea is for users to implement their own domain.
This originates from a research group of DTU, the Technical University of Denmark.

To get started, please **read the [documentation](documentation)**.
